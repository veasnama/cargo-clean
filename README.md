# cargo-clean
Instead of Running cargo clean in each directories which you clone other projects testing. 
/// this is what I just wrote on purpose to make my life eaiser when there are multple rust projects. And then we want to clean all of those at once. 
Instead of go through each dirs and run cargo clean. we just past the folder contains all of those projects. and clean that with multiple threads for each 
directories it goes.
